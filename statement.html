          Growing up, I often experienced the feeling of disconnect from reality.
          During those time, I would imagine myself as an atom floating in the void of space,
          submerge in the quietness, completely unbound.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          The place where the silence is so loud that I can no longer hear the voice inside my head.
          <br>
          Where there is nowhere to go, but I can go anywhere.
          <br>
          Where everything ends, and begins.
          <br>
          <br>
          In this project, I made a space-inspired emulation. The site is built using HTML/CSS, while the interactivity and animation is created using the p5.js library.
          <br>
    
          You are welcome to use the site in whichever way you need â€“ playing around with the interaction,
          gazing at the animation of stars passing by,
          or just let it runs in the background while you study.
    
          <br>
          <br>
    
          I hope you find some resemblance of peace here.
          <br>
