          With the development of the metaverse, everything is becoming virtual. <br>

          My work explores the relationship between emerging real works and virtual environment. In this project, I use Three.js library to create a virtual art gallery that we can go look around while we are sitting at our computer.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Big Space is where I can freely display my art works in everyway I want. Moreover, I can always change the the exhibition or add more artworks to update the gallery later on. The advantage of having a virtual art gallery is I have lots of controls about how I want people to explore the space.

         You are welcome to go around and explore the artworks or playing around with the interactions.

         Thank you for checking out the space.
